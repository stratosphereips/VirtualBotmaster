[BotMaster]
# States
########
# The possible states of the botmaster are: Start, Stop, Nothing, ClickFraud, SendSpam, GetMoreBots, LocalComputation, DDoS, Exfiltration.
# So far the states implemented are: Start, Stop and Nothing.

# Transitions. 
# If you specify a transition, we will move from one state to the other until de end.
# If you specify a 'Stop' state at the end, the botmaster will force all the CC to stop when the its state 'Stop' is reached.
# If you don't specify a 'Stop' state at the end, the botmaster will wait until all the CCs are finished. 
# However, even if all the CC are finished, if the botmaster still has some states to do, it will continue alive until all its states are used.
# 
# Example: states_transitions = Start,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing
states_transitions = Start,Nothing,Nothing,Nothing

# Transition times
# This is the mean and stdev of a normal distribution for the times (in minutes) between states.
# Example to wait 1 day between changing states.
#transition_time = 1440,1 
transition_time = 120,1 

# Some of these states generate a change in the traffic and others do not. It depends on the meaning of the state.
